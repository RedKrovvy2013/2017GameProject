Getting redux-form testing to work:
----------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/tylercollier/redux-form-test

 - upgraded to react v15, as it is required given the project's setup
 - Had to use babel-plugin-webpack-aliases to load in aliases for file paths
 - Using .babelrc to specify usage of above package, with test cmd indicating NODE_ENV=test
 - Using chai (assertions), enzyme (test utility for react) and sinon (mocking)
   as example above user
    - these libs all have high dloads, so should be good to go

Structured package.json so that webpack can build bundle.js on server, via including
webpack-associated modules in the 'dependencies' section, as opposed to 'devDependencies'.


Made decision to go with using bootstrap, as opposed to foundation. Bootstrap's form styling
is much better. Foundation modal solution worked, but had poor design.


'react-bootstrap' was key to getting a professional modal system going
   - failed/poor alternaitves: foundation modal solution, react-bootstrap-modal module
   - dependencies:
      - must use bootstrap 3 css, tried 4 and modal does not show
