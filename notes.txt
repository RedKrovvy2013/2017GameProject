

Structured package.json so that webpack can build bundle.js on server, via including
webpack-associated modules in the 'dependencies' section, as opposed to 'devDependencies'.


Made decision to go with using bootstrap, as opposed to foundation. Bootstrap's form styling
is much better. Foundation modal solution worked, but had poor design.


'react-bootstrap' was key to getting a professional modal system going
   - failed/poor alternaitves: foundation modal solution, react-bootstrap-modal module
   - dependencies:
      - must use bootstrap 3, tried 4 and modal does not show
