# Debateburg

Making a mobile chat-based, debate app using JavaScript, React and Redux as client, and NodeJS and MongoDB as server.

Here is a demo of the prototype. Of course, the two windows would be separate mobile devices.

Here is a list of features:
 * Debaters can register and login, and logout.
 * Upon logging in, a debater shows up in lobby to other debaters.
 * A debater can challenge another debater to a debate, where he/she chooses the resolution and their side, pro or con.
   * The other debater can accept or decline the challenge.
 * Upon accepting, both debaters go to a debate chat room:
   * There are 4 debate phases, 2 for each side.
   * A debater can only enter chat messages while their side, pro or con, is active.
 * Users can view past debates.
