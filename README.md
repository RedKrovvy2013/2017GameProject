# 2017 Project

Making a chat-based web/mobile app using JavaScript, React and Redux as client, and NodeJS and MongoDB as server.

I took a couple Udemy courses to prepare for this project from an outstanding instructor, Andrew Mead. The courses are NodeJS 2.0 and React. I highly recommend them.

To give credit, I adopted code from those courses to start this project.
